## Project topic
Pen & Paper Character Sheet/Editor

We want to make an easy to use and good looking character sheet/editor to help the players with their adventure.
It isn't decided yet which P&P system we want to use in the background, but the user should be able to control 
all their stats and items on this page. Changes on their attributes also influence other values which get updated dynamically.
